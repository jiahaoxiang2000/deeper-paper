\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Related Work}

The \cite{TCHES:Genet23} shows both in theory and experimentally that the countermeasures based on \textit{caching the intermediate
WOTS$^{+}$s} offer a marginally greater protection against unintentional faults. 
For the \cite{AC:CorMan09} show that the Bellcore attack cannot be applied to the \textit{PSS encoding}; namely we show that PSS is provably secure against random fault attacks in the random oracle model, assuming that inverting RSA is hard. 
The \cite{TCHES:THNABC24}  formalizes the \textit{k-fault-resistant partitioning} notion to solve the fault propagation problem when assessing \textit{redundancy-based hardware countermeasures} in a first step. Proven security guarantees can then reduce the remaining hardware attack surface when introducing the software in a second step. which combines the software and hardware countermeasures to provide a more robust solution against fault attacks. 
The \cite{TCHES:DhoOvcTop24} propose a fault countermeasure, StaTI, based on threshold implementations and linear encoding techniques. The proposed countermeasure protects the implementations of cryptographic algorithms against both side-channel and fault adversaries in a non-combined attack setting.
