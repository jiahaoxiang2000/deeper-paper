This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a research project focused on post-quantum cryptography implementation issues, specifically examining ML-DSA (Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm) integration in IoT MQTT environments. The project combines academic research documentation with LaTeX paper writing for cryptographic analysis.

## Research Context

The project addresses NIST's post-quantum cryptography standards with specific focus on:

- ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium based) implementation challenges
- IoT device resource constraints (ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers)
- MQTT protocol integration for post-quantum migration
- Performance analysis of signature generation/verification in constrained environments
- Hybrid classical-quantum authentication approaches
