# A Unified Framework for the Analysis of Side-Channel Key Recovery Attacks

_EUROCRYPT 2009_

## Abstract

this work makes a step in this direction and proposes a framework for the analysis of cryptographic implementations that includes a _theoretical model_ and an _application methodology_.

- From a theoretical point of view, we demonstrate _formal_ connections between these metrics and discuss their intuitive meaning.
- From a practical point of view, the model implies a _unified methodology_ for
  the analysis of side-channel key recovery attacks.

## 1 Introduction

we introduce two diï¬€erent types of evaluation metrics. First, an information _theoretic metric_ is used to measure the amount of information that is provided by a given implementation. Second, an _actual security metric_ is used to measure how this information can be turned into a successful attack.

Namely, we suggest to evaluate implementations with an information theoretic metric (_conditional entropy_) and to evaluate attacks and adversaries with security metrics (success rates or _guessing entropy_)
