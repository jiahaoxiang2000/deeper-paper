# Deeper Paper

In our fourth paper, we aim to explore cryptography more deeply, rather than writing about what we already know. We want to understand the _security_ aspects of cryptography in greater depth, which may involve exploring related _mathematical_ concepts.

> While our major paper focuses on implementation, we have completed enough work to fulfill those requirements. This gives us freedom to explore new areas without limitations.
