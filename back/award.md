# Award paper

In this section, we aim to select the best papers from conferences supported by the _IACR_ committee from 2004-2024, encompassing a total of 183 papers. These papers are of high quality and will serve as the foundation for our own research.

## thought

- the cryptography security always based on the _Assumptions_, one hard problem. then to extend the assumptions for more complex scenarios.
