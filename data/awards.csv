          quantum factoring algorithm (arXiv:2308.06572), addressing its space efficiency and its noise-tolerance.

          Our first contribution is to improve the quantum space efficiency of Regev's algorithm while keeping the
          circuit size the same. Our main result constructs a quantum factoring circuit using $O(n \log n)$ qubits and
          $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates. We achieve the best of Shor and Regev (upto a logarithmic factor in the space
          complexity): on the one hand, Regev's circuit requires $O(n^{3/2})$ qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates,
          while Shor's circuit requires $O(n^2 \log n)$ gates but only $O(n)$ qubits. As with Regev, to factor an
          $n$-bit integer $N$, we run our circuit independently $\approx \sqrt{n}$ times and apply Regev's
          classical postprocessing procedure.

          Our optimization is achieved by implementing efficient and reversible exponentiation with Fibonacci numbers in
          the exponent, rather than the usual powers of 2, adapting work by Kaliski (arXiv:1711.02491) from the
          classical reversible setting to the quantum setting. This technique also allows us to perform quantum modular
          exponentiation that is efficient in both space and size without requiring significant precomputation, a result
          that may be useful for other quantum algorithms. A key ingredient of our exponentiation implementation is an
          efficient circuit for a function resembling \emph{in-place} quantum-quantum modular multiplication. This
          implementation works with only black-box access to any quantum circuit for \emph{out-of-place} modular
          multiplication, which we believe is yet another result of potentially broader interest.

          Our second contribution is to show that Regev's classical postprocessing procedure can be modified to
          tolerate a constant fraction of the quantum circuit runs being corrupted by errors. In contrast, Regev's
          analysis of his classical postprocessing procedure requires all $\approx \sqrt{n}$ runs to be successful. In a
          nutshell, we achieve this using lattice reduction techniques to detect and filter out corrupt samples."

              Arnon, Alessandro Chiesa, Giacomo Fenzi, Eylon Yogev","We present STIR (Shift To Improve Rate), a concretely
          efficient interactive oracle proof of proximity (IOPP) for Reed--Solomon codes that achieves the best known
          query complexity of any concretely efficient IOPP for this problem. Roughly, in order to achieve $\lambda$
          bits of security, STIR has query complexity $O(\log d + \lambda \cdot \loglog d )$, while the popular FRI
          protocol (including variants based on conjectured security assumptions) has query complexity $O(\lambda \cdot
          \log d )$. STIR relies on a new technique for recursively reducing the degree of the function being tested
          while simultaneously improving the rate.

          We provide an implementation of STIR compiled to a SNARK. Compared to FRI, our implementation achieves an
          improvement in argument size that ranges from $1.25\times$ to $2.46\times$ depending on the chosen parameters.
          For example, in order to achieve 128 bits of security for degree $2^{26}$ and rate $1/4$, STIR has argument

            Researchers","Quang
              Dao, Aayush Jain","Over the past few decades, we have seen a proliferation
          of advanced cryptographic primitives with lossy or homomorphic properties built from various assumptions such
          as Quadratic Residuosity, Decisional Diffie-Hellman, and Learning with Errors. These primitives imply hard
          problems in the complexity class $\mathcal{SZK}$ (statistical zero-knowledge); as a consequence, they can only
          be based on assumptions that are broken in $\mathcal{BPP}^{\mathcal{SZK}}$.
          This poses a barrier for building advanced cryptography from code-based assumptions such as Learning Parity
          with Noise (LPN), as LPN is only known to be in $\mathcal{BPP}^{\mathcal{SZK}}$ under an extremely low noise
          rate $\frac{\log^2 n}{n}$, for which it is broken in quasi-polynomial time.

          In this work, we propose a new code-based assumption: Dense-Sparse LPN, that falls in the complexity class
          $\mathcal{BPP}^{\mathcal{SZK}}$ and is conjectured to be secure against subexponential time adversaries. Our
          assumption is a variant of LPN that is inspired by McEliece's cryptosystem and random $k\mbox{-}$XOR in
          average-case complexity. Roughly, the assumption states that
          \[(\mathbf{T}\, \mathbf{M}, \mathbf{s} \,\mathbf{T}\, \mathbf{M} + \mathbf{e}) \quad \text{is
          indistinguishable from}\quad (\mathbf{T} \,\mathbf{M}, \mathbf{u}),\]
          for a random (dense) matrix $\mathbf{T}$, random sparse matrix $\mathbf{M}$, and sparse noise vector
          $\mathbf{e}$ drawn from the Bernoulli distribution with inverse polynomial noise probability.

          We leverage our assumption to build lossy trapdoor functions (Peikert-Waters STOC 08). This gives the first
          post-quantum alternative to the lattice-based construction in the original paper. Lossy trapdoor functions,
          being a fundamental cryptographic tool, are known to enable a broad spectrum of both lossy and non-lossy
          cryptographic primitives; our construction thus implies these primitives in a generic manner. In particular,
          we achieve collision-resistant hash functions with plausible subexponential security, improving over a prior
          construction from LPN with noise rate $\frac{\log^2 n}{n}$ that is only quasi-polynomially secure."

          used for encrypting automatic link establishment (ALE) messages in high frequency radio, a technology commonly
          used by the military, other government agencies and industries which require high robustness in long-distance
          communications. Recently, it was shown in [DDLS22] that the smallest version of the cipher, HALFLOOP-24, can
          be attacked within a practical time and memory complexity. However, in the real-word ALE setting, it turns out
          that this attack require to wait more than 500 years to collect the necessary amount of
          plaintext-tweak-ciphertext pairs fulfilling the conditions of the attack.In this paper, we present real-world
          practical attacks against HALFLOOP-24 which are based on a probability-one differential distinguisher. In our
          attacks, we significantly reduce the data complexity to three differential pairs in the chosen-plaintext (CPA)
          setting which is optimal in the sense that even a brute force attack needs at least six
          plaintext-tweak-ciphertext pairs to uniquely identify the correct key. Considering the same ALE setting as
          [DDLS22], this translates to a reduction from 541 years to 2 hours worth of intercepted traffic.Besides, we
          provide the first, non generic, public cryptanalysis of HALFLOOP-48 and HALFLOOP-96. More precisely, we
          present Demirci-Selçuk meet-in-the-middle attacks against full-round HALFLOOP-48 and round-reduced HALFLOOP-96
          to recover the complete master key in a CPA setting. However, unlike the attacks on HALFLOOP-24, our attacks
          on the larger versions are only theoretical. Moreover for HALFLOOP-96 the known generic time-memory trade-off
          attack, based on a flawed tweak handling, remains the strongest attack vector.In conclusion, we iterate what
          was already stated in [DDLS22]: HALFLOOP does not provide adequate protection and should not be used."

              Boeuf, Anne Canteaut, Léo Perrin","Motivated by progress in the field of zero-knowledge
          proofs, so-called Arithmetization-Oriented (AO) symmetric primitives have started to appear in the literature,
          such as MiMC, Poseidon or Rescue. Due to the design constraints implied by this setting, these algorithms are
          defined using simple operations over large (possibly prime) fields. In particular, many rely on simple
          low-degree monomials for their non-linear layers, essentially using x ↦ x3 as an S-box.In this paper, we show
          that the structure of the material injected in each round (be it subkeys in a block cipher or round constants
          in a public permutation) could allow a specific pattern, whereby a well-defined affine space is mapped to
          another by the round function, and then to another, etc. Such chains of one-dimensional subspaces always exist
          over 2 rounds, and they can be extended to an arbitrary number of rounds, for any linear layer, provided that
          the round-constants are well chosen.As a consequence, for several ciphers like Rescue, or a variant of AES
          with a monomial Sbox, there exist some round-key sequences for which the cipher has an abnormally high
          differential uniformity, exceeding the size of the Sbox alphabet.Well-known security arguments, in particular
          based on the wide-trail strategy, have been reused in the AO setting by many designers. Unfortunately, our
          results show that such a traditional study may not be sufficient to guarantee security. To illustrate this, we
          present two new primitives (the tweakable block cipher Snare and the permutation-based hash function Stir)
          that are built using state-of-the-art security arguments, but which are actually deeply flawed. Indeed, the
          key schedule of Snare ensures the presence of a subspace chain that significantly simplifies an algebraic
          attack against it, and the round constants of Stir force the presence of a subspace chain aligned with the
          rate and capacity of the permutation. This in turns implies the existence of many easy-to-find solutions to
          the so-called CICO problem."

              Mathialagan","When outsourcing a database to an untrusted remote
          server, one might want to verify the integrity of contents while accessing it. To solve this, Blum et al.
          [FOCS `91] propose the notion of \emph{memory checking}. Memory checking allows a user to run a RAM program on
          a remote server, with the ability to verify integrity of the storage with small private storage.

          In this work, we define and initiate the formal study of memory checking for \emph{Parallel RAMs} (PRAMs). The
          parallel RAM model is very expressive and captures many modern architectures such as multi-core architectures
          and cloud clusters. When multiple clients run a PRAM algorithm on a shared remote server, it is possible that
          there are concurrency issues that cause inconsistencies. Therefore, integrity verification is also a desirable
          property in this setting.

          We construct an online memory checker (one that reports faults as soon as they occur) for PRAMs with $O(\log
          N)$ simulation overhead in both work and depth. Moreover, we construct an offline memory checker (one that
          reports faults only after a long sequence of operations) with amortized $O(1)$ simulation overhead in both
          work and depth. As an application of our parallel memory checking constructions, we construct a
          \emph{maliciously secure oblivious parallel RAM} (OPRAM) with polylogarithmic overhead."

          threshold
          Schnorr signature scheme, which we call Sparkle. The standard notion of
          security for threshold signatures considers a static adversary - one who
          must declare which parties are corrupt at the beginning of the protocol.
          The stronger adaptive adversary can at any time corrupt parties and
          learn their state. This notion is natural and practical, yet not proven to
          be met by most schemes in the literature.

          In this paper, we demonstrate that Sparkle achieves several levels of
          security based on different corruption models and assumptions. To begin
          with, Sparkle is statically secure under minimal assumptions: the discrete
          logarithm assumption (DL) and the random oracle model (ROM). If an
          adaptive adversary corrupts fewer than t/2 out of a threshold of t+1
          signers, then Sparkle is adaptively secure under a weaker variant of the
          one-more discrete logarithm assumption (AOMDL) in the ROM. Finally,
          we prove that Sparkle achieves full adaptive security, with a corruption
          threshold of t, under AOMDL in the algebraic group model (AGM) with
          random oracles. Importantly, we show adaptive security without requiring
          secure erasures. Ours is the first proof achieving full adaptive security
          without exponential tightness loss for any threshold Schnorr signature
          scheme; moreover, the reduction is tight."

          context of public-key encryption (PKE) and key establishment. The main security target for KEMs, and their
          associated PKE schemes, in the NIST PQC context has been IND-CCA security. However, some important modern
          applications also require their underlying KEMs/PKE schemes to provide anonymity (Bellare et al., ASIACRYPT
          2001). Examples of such applications include anonymous credential systems, cryptocurrencies, broadcast
          encryption schemes, authenticated key exchange, and auction protocols. It is hence important to analyze the
          compatibility of NIST's new PQC standard in such ""beyond IND-CCA"" applications.

          Some starting steps were taken by Grubbs et al. (EUROCRYPT 2022) and Xagawa (EUROCRYPT 2022) wherein they

              Chavez-Saab, Francisco Rodriguez-Henriquez, Mehdi Tibouchi","Hashing arbitrary values to points on an elliptic curve
          is a required
          step in many cryptographic constructions, and a number of techniques have
          been proposed to do so over the years. One of the first ones was due to
          Shallue and van de Woestijne (ANTS-VII), and it had the interesting
          property of applying to essentially all elliptic curves over finite
          fields. It did not, however, have the desirable property of being
          *indifferentiable from a random oracle* when composed with a random
          oracle to the base field.

          Various approaches have since been considered to overcome this
          limitation, starting with the foundational work of Brier et al. (CRYPTO
          2011). For example, if f: F_q→E(F_q) is the Shallue--van de
          Woestijne (SW) map and H, H' are *two* independent random oracles,
          we now know that m↦f(H(m))+f(H'(m)) is
          indifferentiable from a random oracle. Unfortunately, this approach has
          the drawback of being twice as expensive to compute than the
          straightforward, but not indifferentiable, m↦f(H(m)).
          Most other solutions so far have had the same issue: they are at least as
          costly as two base field exponentiations, whereas plain encoding maps
          like f cost only one exponentiation. Recently, Koshelev (DCC 2022)
          provided the first construction of indifferentiable hashing at the cost
          of one exponentiation, but only for a very specific class of curves
          (some of those with j-invariant 0), and using techniques that are unlikely to
          apply more broadly.

          In this work, we revisit this long-standing open problem, and observe
          that the SW map actually fits in a one-parameter family (f_u)_{u∈F_q}
          of encodings, such that for independent random oracles H, H',
          F: m↦f_{H'(m)}(H(m)) is indifferentiable. Moreover, on a
          very large class of curves (essentially those that are either of odd
          order or of order divisible by 4), the one-parameter family admits a
          rational parametrization, which lets us compute F at almost the same
          cost as small f, and finally achieve indifferentiable hashing to most
          curves with a single exponentiation.

          Our new approach also yields an improved variant of the Elligator Squared
          technique of Tibouchi (FC 2014) that represents points of arbitrary
          elliptic curves as close-to-uniform random strings."

          with a ""deterministic"" form of circular security with respect to the seed of the PRG (Koppula and
          Waters, CRYPTO 2019). Hinting PRGs enable many cryptographic applications, most notably CCA-secure public-key
          encryption and trapdoor functions. In this paper, we study cryptographic primitives with the hinting property,
          yielding the following results:

          - We present a novel and conceptually simpler approach for designing hinting PRGs from certain decisional
          assumptions over cyclic groups or isogeny-based group actions, which enables simpler security proofs as
          compared to the existing approaches for designing such primitives.

          - We introduce hinting weak PRFs, a natural extension of the hinting property to weak PRFs, and show how to
          realize circular/KDM-secure symmetric-key encryption from any hinting weak PRF. We demonstrate that our simple
          approach for building hinting PRGs can be extended to realize hinting weak PRFs from the same set of
          decisional assumptions.

          - We propose a stronger version of the hinting property, which we call the functional hinting property, that
          guarantees security even in the presence of hints about functions of the secret seed/key. We show how to
          instantiate functional hinting PRGs and functional hinting weak PRFs for certain (families of) functions by
          building upon our simple techniques for realizing plain hinting PRGs/weak PRFs. We also demonstrate the
          applicability of a functional hinting weak PRF with certain algebraic properties in realizing KDM-secure
          public-key encryption in a black-box manner.

          - Finally, we show the first black-box separation between hinting weak PRFs (and hinting PRGs) from public-key
          encryption using simple realizations of these primitives given only a random oracle."

          distributions X_0Y_0,X_1Y_1 are d_X+d_Y indistinguishable for slightly smaller circuits. However, in
          probability theory where unbounded adversaries are considered through statistical distance, it is folklore
          knowledge that in fact X_0Y_0 and X_1Y_1 are d_x+d_y-d_x*d_y indistinguishable, and also that this bound is
          tight.

          We formulate and prove the computational analog of this tight bound. Our proof is entirely different from the
          proof in the statistical case, which is non-constructive. As a corollary, we show that if X and Y are d
          indistinguishable, then k independent copies of X and k independent copies of Y are almost 1-(1-d)^k
          indistinguishable for smaller circuits, as against d*k using the looser bound. Our bounds are useful in
          settings where only weak (i.e. non-negligible) indistinguishability is guaranteed. We demonstrate this in the

          multiple NP statements with communication much smaller than the total witness length and verification time
          much smaller than individually checking each instance.

          In this work, we give the first construction of a non-interactive batch argument for NP from standard
          assumptions on groups with bilinear maps (specifically, from either the subgroup decision assumption in
          composite-order groups or from the k-Lin assumption in prime-order groups for any k >= 1). Previously,
          batch arguments for NP were only known from LWE, or a combination of multiple assumptions, or from
          non-standard/non-falsifiable assumptions. Moreover, our work introduces a new direct approach for batch
          verification and avoids heavy tools like correlation-intractable hash functions or probabilistically-checkable
          proofs common to previous approaches.

          As corollaries to our main construction, we obtain the first publicly-verifiable non-interactive delegation

          Kolmogorov complexity problem. In this work, we establish a similar
          equivalence but to a different form of time-bounded Kolmogorov
          Complexity---namely, Levin's notion of Kolmogorov Complexity---whose
          hardness is closely related to the problem of whether $\EXP \neq
          \BPP$. In more detail, let $Kt(x)$ denote the Levin-Kolmogorov Complexity of the string $x$;
          that is, $Kt(x) = \min_{\desc \in \bitset^*, t \in \N}\{|\desc| +
          \lceil \log t \rceil: U(\desc, 1^t) = x\}$, where $U$ is a universal
          Turing machine, and let $\mktp$ denote the language of pairs $(x,k)$ having
          the property that $Kt(x) \leq k$.
          We demonstrate that:
          - $\mktp$ is \emph{two-sided error} mildly average-case hard (i.e., $\mktp

          ruled out classical black-box reductions among cryptographic primitives.
          Therefore it may be possible to overcome these impossibility results by using quantum reductions.
          To exclude such a possibility, we have to extend these impossibility results to the quantum setting.

          In this paper, we study black-box impossibility in the quantum setting.
          We first formalize a quantum counterpart of fully-black-box reduction following the formalization by Reingold,
          Trevisan and Vadhan (TCC 2004).
          Then we prove that there is no quantum fully-black-box reduction from collision-resistant hash functions to
          one-way permutations (or even trapdoor permutations).
          We take both of classical and quantum implementations of primitives into account.
          This is an extension to the quantum setting of the work of Simon (Eurocrypt 1998) who showed a similar result
          in the classical setting."

          Targeting the post-quantum NIST-1 level of security, our implementation results in signatures of $204$ bytes,

          workstation, our implementation in C takes 0.6s for key generation, 2.5s for signing, and 50ms for
          verification.

          While the soundness of the identification protocol follows from classical assumptions, the zero-knowledge
          property relies on the second main contribution of this paper.
          We introduce a new algorithm to find an isogeny path connecting two given supersingular elliptic curves of

          A previous algorithm to solve this problem, due to Kohel, Lauter, Petit and Tignol, systematically reveals

          cryptanalysis: breaking block ciphers, forging signatures, and cracking password hashes are all special cases
          of the function-inversion problem. In 1980, Hellman showed that it is possible to invert a random function
          $$f{:}\,[N] \rightarrow [N]$$ in time $$T = \widetilde{O}(N^{2/3})$$ given only $$S = \widetilde{O}(N^{2/3})$$
          bits of precomputed advice about f. Hellman’s algorithm is the basis for the popular “Rainbow Tables”
          technique (Oechslin 2003), which achieves the same asymptotic cost and is widely used in practical
          cryptanalysis.Is Hellman’s method the best possible algorithm for inverting functions with preprocessed
          advice? The best known lower bound, due to Yao (1990), shows that $$ST = \widetilde{\Omega }(N)$$, which still
          admits the possibility of an $$S = T = \widetilde{O}(N^{1/2})$$ attack. There remains a long-standing and
          vexing gap between Hellman’s $$N^{2/3}$$ upper bound and Yao’s $$N^{1/2}$$ lower bound. Understanding the
          feasibility of an $$S = T = N^{1/2}$$ algorithm is cryptanalytically relevant since such an algorithm could
          perform a key-recovery attack on AES-128 in time $$2^{64}$$ using a precomputed table of size $$2^{64}$$.For
          the past 29 years, there has been no progress either in improving Hellman’s algorithm or in strengthening
          Yao’s lower bound. In this work, we connect function inversion to problems in other areas of theory to (1)
          explain why progress may be difficult and (2) explore possible ways forward.Our results are as follows:We show
          that any improvement on Yao’s lower bound on function-inversion algorithms will imply new lower bounds on
          depth-two circuits with arbitrary gates. Further, we show that proving strong lower bounds on non-adaptive
          function-inversion algorithms would imply breakthrough circuit lower bounds on linear-size log-depth
          circuits.We take first steps towards the study of the injective function-inversion problem, which has manifold
          cryptographic applications. In particular, we show that improved algorithms for breaking PRGs with
          preprocessing would give improved algorithms for inverting injective functions with preprocessing.Finally, we
          show that function inversion is closely related to well-studied problems in communication complexity and data
          structures. Through these connections we immediately obtain the best known algorithms for problems in these
          domains."

          Threshold Implementations (TIs), Domain-Oriented Masking (DOM), the Unified Masking Approach (UMA) and Generic
          Low Latency Masking (GLM). The latter generally come with innovative ideas to cope with physical defaults such
          as glitches. Yet, and in contrast to the situation in software-oriented masking, these schemes have not been

          only a 2-cycle implementation of the seminal masking scheme by Ishai, Sahai and Wagner has been shown secure

          refreshing. We then show that composability and robustness against glitches cannot be analyzed independently.
          We finally detail how these abstract flaws translate into concrete (experimental) attacks, and discuss the
          additional constraints robust probing security implies on the need of registers. Despite not systematically
          leading to improved complexities at low security orders, e.g., with respect to the required number of

              Zhandry","Public key quantum money can be seen as a version of the
          quantum no-cloning theorem that holds even when the quantum states can be verified by the adversary. In this
          work, we investigate quantum lightning where no-cloning holds even when the adversary herself generates the
          quantum state to be cloned. We then study quantum money and quantum lightning, showing the following
          results:We demonstrate the usefulness of quantum lightning beyond quantum money by showing several potential
          applications, such as generating random strings with a proof of entropy, to completely decentralized
          cryptocurrency without a block-chain, where transactions is instant and local.We give Either/Or results for
          quantum money/lightning, showing that either signatures/hash functions/commitment schemes meet very strong
          recently proposed notions of security, or they yield quantum money or lightning. Given the difficulty in
          constructing public key quantum money, this suggests that natural schemes do attain strong security
          guarantees.We show that instantiating the quantum money scheme of Aaronson and Christiano [STOC’12] with
          indistinguishability obfuscation that is secure against quantum computers yields a secure quantum money
          scheme. This construction can be seen as an instance of our Either/Or result for signatures, giving the first
          separation between two security notions for signatures from the literature.Finally, we give a plausible
          construction for quantum lightning, which we prove secure under an assumption related to the multi-collision
          resistance of degree-2 hash functions. Our construction is inspired by our Either/Or result for hash
          functions, and yields the first plausible standard model instantiation of a non-collapsing collision resistant
          hash function. This improves on a result of Unruh [Eurocrypt’16] which is relative to a quantum oracle."

              Larsen, Jesper Buus Nielsen","An Oblivious RAM (ORAM) introduced by Goldreich and
          Ostrovsky [JACM’96] is a (possibly randomized) RAM, for which the memory access pattern reveals no information
          about the operations performed. The main performance metric of an ORAM is the bandwidth overhead, i.e., the
          multiplicative factor extra memory blocks that must be accessed to hide the operation sequence. In their
          seminal paper introducing the ORAM, Goldreich and Ostrovsky proved an amortized
          $$\varOmega (\lg n)$$
          bandwidth overhead lower bound for ORAMs with memory size n. Their lower bound is very strong in the sense
          that it applies to the “offline” setting in which the ORAM knows the entire sequence of operations ahead of
          time.However, as pointed out by Boyle and Naor [ITCS’16] in the paper “Is there an oblivious RAM lower
          bound?”, there are two caveats with the lower bound of Goldreich and Ostrovsky: (1) it only applies to “balls
          in bins” algorithms, i.e., algorithms where the ORAM may only shuffle blocks around and not apply any
          sophisticated encoding of the data, and (2), it only applies to statistically secure constructions. Boyle and
          Naor showed that removing the “balls in bins” assumption would result in super linear lower bounds for sorting
          circuits, a long standing open problem in circuit complexity. As a way to circumventing this barrier, they
          also proposed a notion of an “online” ORAM, which is an ORAM that remains secure even if the operations arrive
          in an online manner. They argued that most known ORAM constructions work in the online setting as well.Our
          contribution is an
          $$\varOmega (\lg n)$$
          lower bound on the bandwidth overhead of any online ORAM, even if we require only computational security and
          allow arbitrary representations of data, thus greatly strengthening the lower bound of Goldreich and Ostrovsky
          in the online setting. Our lower bound applies to ORAMs with memory size n and any word size
          $$r \ge 1$$
          . The bound therefore asymptotically matches the known upper bounds when
          $$r = \varOmega (\lg ^2 n)$$

            Lattices","Best Young Researcher Paper","Sam Kim, David J. Wu","Non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs are
          fundamental to modern cryptography. Numerous NIZK constructions are known in both the random oracle and the
          common reference string (CRS) models. In the CRS model, there exist constructions from several classes of
          cryptographic assumptions such as trapdoor permutations, pairings, and indistinguishability obfuscation.
          Notably absent from this list, however, are constructions from standard lattice assumptions. While there has
          been partial progress in realizing NIZKs from lattices for specific languages, constructing NIZK proofs (and
          arguments) for all of $$\mathsf {NP}$$ from standard lattice assumptions remains open.   In this work, we make
          progress on this problem by giving the first construction of a multi-theorem NIZK argument for $$\mathsf
          {NP}$$ from standard lattice assumptions in the preprocessing model. In the preprocessing model, a (trusted)
          setup algorithm generates proving and verification keys. The proving key is needed to construct proofs and the
          verification key is needed to check proofs. In the multi-theorem setting, the proving and verification keys
          should be reusable for an unbounded number of theorems without compromising soundness or zero-knowledge.
          Existing constructions of NIZKs in the preprocessing model (or even the designated-verifier model) that rely
          on weaker assumptions like one-way functions or oblivious transfer are only secure in a single-theorem
          setting. Thus, constructing multi-theorem NIZKs in the preprocessing model does not seem to be inherently
          easier than constructing them in the CRS model.   We begin by constructing a multi-theorem preprocessing NIZK
          directly from context-hiding homomorphic signatures. Then, we show how to efficiently implement the
          preprocessing step using a new cryptographic primitive called blind homomorphic signatures. This primitive may
          be of independent interest. Finally, we show how to leverage our new lattice-based preprocessing NIZKs to
          obtain new malicious-secure MPC protocols purely from standard lattice assumptions."

          NP⊈BPP is at the very heart of complexity-theoretic cryptography. The closest we have gotten so far is
          lattice-based cryptography whose average-case security is based on the worst-case hardness of approximate
          shortest vector problems on integer lattices. The state-of-the-art is the construction of a one-way function
          (and collision-resistant hash function) based on the hardness of the

              Albrecht, Amit Deo, Kenneth G. Paterson","In this work, we consider the ring- and module- variants
          of the LWE problem and investigate cold boot attacks on cryptographic schemes based on these problems, wherein
          an attacker is faced with the problem of recovering a scheme’s secret key from a noisy version of that key.
          The leakage resilience of cryptography based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem has been studied
          before, but there are only limited results considering the parameters observed in cold boot attack scenarios.
          There are two main encodings for storing ring- and module-LWE keys, and, as we show, the performance of cold
          boot attacks can be highly sensitive to the exact encoding used. The first encoding stores polynomial
          coefficients directly in memory. The second encoding performs a number theoretic transform (NTT) before
          storing the key, a commonly used method leading to more efficient implementations. We first give estimates for
          a cold boot attack complexity on the first encoding method based on standard algorithms; this analysis
          confirms that this encoding method is vulnerable to cold boot attacks only at very low bit-flip rates. We then
          show that, for the second encoding method, the structure introduced by using an NTT is exploitable in the cold
          boot setting: we develop a bespoke attack strategy that is much cheaper than our estimates for the first
          encoding when considering module-LWE keys. For example, at a 1% bit-flip rate (which corresponds roughly to
          what can be achieved in practice for cold boot attacks when applying cooling), a cold boot attack on Kyber KEM
          parameters has a cost of 243 operations when the second, NTT-based encoding is used for key storage, compared
          to 270 operations with the first encoding. On the other hand, in the case of the ring-LWE-based KEM, New Hope,
          the cold boot attack complexities are similar for both encoding methods."

              Chaigneau, Thomas Fuhr, Henri Gilbert, Jian Guo, Jérémy Jean, Jean-René Reinhard, Ling Song","This paper presents a cryptanalysis of full Kravatte, an
          instantiation of the Farfalle construction of a pseudorandom function (PRF) with variable input and output
          length. This new construction, proposed by Bertoni et al., introduces an efficiently parallelizable and
          extremely versatile building block for the design of symmetric mechanisms, e.g. message authentication codes
          or stream ciphers. It relies on a set of permutations and on so-called rolling functions: it can be split into
          a compression layer followed by a two-step expansion layer. The key is expanded and used to mask the inputs
          and outputs of the construction. Kravatte instantiates Farfalle using linear rolling functions and
          permutations obtained by iterating the Keccak round function.We develop in this paper several attacks against
          this PRF, based on three different attack strategies that bypass part of the construction and target a reduced
          number of permutation rounds. A higher order differential distinguisher exploits the possibility to build an
          affine space of values in the cipher state after the compression layer. An algebraic meet-in-the-middle attack
          can be mounted on the second step of the expansion layer. Finally, due to the linearity of the rolling
          function and the low algebraic degree of the Keccak round function, a linear recurrence distinguisher can be
          found on intermediate states of the second step of the expansion layer. All the attacks rely on the ability to
          invert a small number of the final rounds of the construction. In particular, the last two rounds of the
          construction together with the final masking by the key can be algebraically inverted, which allows to recover
          the key.The complexities of the devised attacks, applied to the Kravatte specifications published on the IACR
          ePrint in July 2017, or the strengthened version of Kravatte recently presented at ECC 2017, are far below the
          security claimed."
