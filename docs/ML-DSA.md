Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard

Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory.

**Keywords:** digital signature, public key cryptography, lattice.

## Introduction

### purpose & scope

The digital signature scheme approved in this standard is the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), which is based on the **Module Learning With Errors problem [4]**.

## Notation

### Rings

Elements of the rings $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}_q$, $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $R$, and $R_q$ are denoted by italicized lowercase letters (e.g., $w$). Elements of the ring $T_q$ are length-256 arrays of elements of $\mathbb{Z}_q$, and they are denoted by italicized letters with a hat symbol (e.g., $\hat{w}$). The addition and multiplication of elements of $T_q$ are performed entry-wise. Thus, the $i$th entry of the product of two elements $\hat{u}$ and $\hat{v}$ of $T_q$ is $\hat{u}[i] \cdot \hat{v}[i] \in \mathbb{Z}_q$. The multiplication operation in $T_q$ is denoted by the symbol $\circ$ (see Section 2.3).

When a product $a \cdot b$ or a sum $a + b$ is written and either $a$ or $b$ is a congruence class modulo $m$ (i.e., if either $a$ or $b$ is an element of $\mathbb{Z}_m$ or $R_m$), then the product or sum is also understood to be a congruence class modulo $m$ (i.e., an element of $\mathbb{Z}_m$ or $R_m$). Likewise, an element of $R$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ may be “typecast” to an element of $R_m$ or $\mathbb{Z}_m$, respectively, and may be used as the input of a function specified to act on an element of $R_m$ or $\mathbb{Z}_m$, respectively. In both cases, the element itself or its coefficients are mapped from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_m$ by taking the unique congruence class modulo $m$ that contains the integer.

The coefficients of an element $w$ of $R$ or $R_m$ are denoted by $w_i$ so that $w = w_0 + w_1 X + \dots + w_{255} X^{255}$. If $w$ is in $R$ (respectively, $R_m$) and $t$ is in $\mathbb{Z}$ (respectively, $\mathbb{Z}_d$), then $w(t)$ denotes the polynomial $w = w_0 + w_1 X + \dots + w_{255} X^{255}$ evaluated at $X = t$.

### NTT Representation

The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a specific isomorphism between the rings $R_q$ and $T_q$. Let $\zeta = 1753 \in \mathbb{Z}_q$, which is a 512th root of unity. If $w \in R_q$, then

$$
\mathrm{NTT}(w) = (w(\zeta^0), w(\zeta^1), \ldots, w(\zeta^{255})) \in T_q,
$$

where $\zeta^i = w(\zeta^{2\mathrm{BitRev}_8(i)+1}) \bmod q$. See Section 7.5 for an implementation discussion for NTT and $\mathrm{NTT}^{-1}$.

The motivation for using NTT is that multiplication is considerably faster in the ring $T_q$. Since NTT is an isomorphism, for any $a, b \in R_q$,

$$
\mathrm{NTT}(ab) = \mathrm{NTT}(a) \circ \mathrm{NTT}(b).
$$

If $\mathbf{A}$ is a matrix with entries from $R_q$, then $\mathrm{NTT}(\mathbf{A})$ denotes the matrix computed via the entry-wise application of NTT to $\mathbf{A}$. The symbol $\circ$ is also used to denote the matrix multiplication of matrices with entries in $T_q$. Thus,

$$
\mathrm{NTT}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}) = \mathrm{NTT}(\mathbf{A}) \circ \mathrm{NTT}(\mathbf{B}).
$$

Explicit algorithms for linear algebra over $T_q$ are given in Section 7.6.
