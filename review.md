Major innovation issue

The claimed innovation centers on an “adaptive security level selection protocol” layered on top of existing ML-DSA parameter sets, but the paper does not establish that this is a novel protocol rather than a straightforward policy choice (selecting ML-DSA-44/65/87 based on message criticality and a resource score). The contribution reads as a heuristic configuration rule rather than a new algorithm or protocol with clearly distinct properties, and it is not positioned against prior adaptive or hybrid schemes. As a result, the work’s main “innovation” appears to be an application-level parameter selection policy rather than a substantive new cryptographic or MQTT protocol mechanism.

Evidence: the three listed contributions emphasize the adaptive protocol, benchmarking, and MQTT integration without demonstrating novelty beyond standard parameter tuning (see the contributions list in deeper-paper/tex/index.tex:134 and the protocol description in deeper-paper/tex/index.tex:215). The algorithm itself is a simple threshold-based selection on a weighted resource score (deeper-paper/tex/index.tex:255), with no formal security model, proof, or comparison to existing adaptive-security approaches. This weakens the paper’s innovation claim because the protocol’s behavior appears to be a conventional design choice rather than a new technique.
